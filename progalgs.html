The book "Programming Algorithms (A comprehensive guide to writing efficient programs with examples in Lisp)" is intended as an introduction to both algorithmic development and Common Lisp. It is more than 360 pages long in a standard technical book format, with over 100k words. The table of contents lists more 100 topics that cover the following areas:

<ul>
  <li>All the important data structures and algorithms.</li>
  <li>Essential tools that help in the development of algorithmic code.</li>
  <li>Real-world engineering considerations and constraints that influence the programs that use these algorithms.</li>
  <li>Practical use cases of the applications of the algorithms to a variety of real-world problems.</li>
  <li>The implementation of all of the above in Lisp.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is a lot of books on algorithms, but I haven't seen any that primarily aims to bridge the gap between the theory and practice. This is one of the key distinctions of "Programming Algorithms". It is definitely not the best exposition of the theoretical ideas, but I hope that, instead, it builds sufficient understanding and skill, for the common developer, to start writing efficient algorithmic programs.

<p>Here's a couple of reviews from the readers:

<blockquote>Greetings from the far away city of Lima, Peru!<br>
I loved this part: "Only losers don‚Äôt comment their code, and comments will be used extensively"<br>
Thank you so much for putting this comprehensive collection of highly important data structures, i'm already recommending this to two of my developers, which I hope i'll induce into my Lisp addiction.<br>
--Flavio Egoavil 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Massively impressive book you've written! I've been a Lisp programmer for a long time and truly appreciate the work put in here. Making Lisp accessible for more people in relation to practical algorithms is very hard to do. But you truly made it. You'll definitely end up in the gallery of great and modern Lisp contributions like "Land of Lisp" and "Let Over Lambda". Totally agree with your path to focus on practical algorithmic thinking with Lisp and not messing it up with macros, oop and other advanced concepts.<br>
--Lars H√•rd
